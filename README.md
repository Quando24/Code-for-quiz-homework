# <Code-for-quiz-homework>
## Description 
This project/homework assignment involved me creating a functional quiz with a timer, in order to time the user and to see how many the user gets correct in the specific time amount. Then the score and user's initials would be saved to the console. My motivation behind developing this assignment was furthering my understanding of javascript and figuring out how to properly utilize functions. I built this project because I wanted to see what steps were necessary in creating such a responsive project and to at the very least, attempt to figure out the complicated nature of javascript. The problem solved was learning how to create a function with working buttons, inside such a function, in order to develop a website with functionality that most users are used to.

## Installation
Firstly, I have to place my work onto Github. In order to install the work onto Github, firstly you have to create an account. Then you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
